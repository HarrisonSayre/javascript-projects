    <p>Ideally I would like to craft a website containing a character creation tool of some sort for a tabletop roleplaying game. Dungeons & Dragons is the cliche answer, but frankly
      there are no shortage of those. Something like Pendragon or Deadlands instead would work better, imo. It would take user input, save date, allow users to upload data, display 
      a character sheet, and allow for random generation. A free resource for fellow fans. Well, that's the first idea that sprung to my head, anyhow.
